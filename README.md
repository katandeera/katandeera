- 👋 Hi, I’m @katandeera
- 👀 I’m interested in poetic-sensible ways to design the presentation of environmental data, obtained in situ and in real-time through monitoring practices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently completing a research-creation project as part of a masters in Environmental Design at UQAM (Montreal)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seek to associate real-time environmental data, human voice and/or spatialized sound. 
- 📫 You can reach me per email at despondanne@gmail.com
